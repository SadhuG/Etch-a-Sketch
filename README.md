# Etch a Sketch

Welcome to the Etch a Sketch repository! This project is a simple webpage that features a grid canvas. As you hover your mouse cursor over it, you leave can fill in the colors and paint a masterpiece (a pixelated one) on your screen.

It's built upon my [Trailing Tails](https://github.com/SadhuG/Trailing-Tails) repository.
